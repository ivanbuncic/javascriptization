<p class="p-8 border rounded-md bg-grey-200 text-xl sm:text-2xl font-mono italic"><span class="text-6xl text-grey-500 font-bold">&ldquo;</span>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
